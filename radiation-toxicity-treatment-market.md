<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Toxicity Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionizing Radiation</li><li>Non-ionizing Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radiation Toxicity Treatment Market is categorized into two main types: Ionizing and Non-ionizing Radiation. Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, has enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, potentially causing cellular damage and cancers, necessitating treatments like chelation therapy and stem cell transplants. Non-ionizing radiation, including microwaves and radiofrequency, poses lower risk, yet prolonged exposure can lead to thermal damage and require supportive care. Both markets focus on developing effective mitigation and treatment solutions for radiation exposure effects.</p></p>
