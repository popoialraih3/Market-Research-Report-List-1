<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis Dialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis machines market is primarily divided into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis machines filter blood outside the body using a dialyzer, requiring a connection to a blood vessel and typically done in clinics or at home. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis utilizes the body's peritoneal membrane for filtration, with fluid inserted into the abdominal cavity, allowing patients greater flexibility and independence. Both types cater to individuals with kidney failure, providing essential treatment options tailored to different needs.</p></p>
