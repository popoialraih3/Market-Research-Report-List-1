<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Track Geometry Trolley Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Measurement</li><li>Non-contact Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Track Geometry Trolley market consists of two main types: contact measurement and non-contact measurement. Contact measurement systems involve physical sensors that make direct contact with the track to assess parameters like alignment and elevation. In contrast, non-contact measurement systems utilize technologies such as lasers or cameras to gather data without physical contact, allowing for faster and potentially safer inspections. Both types are essential for monitoring track conditions, ensuring safety, and maintaining optimal railway performance.</p></p>
