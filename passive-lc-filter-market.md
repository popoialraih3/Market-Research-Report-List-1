<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive LC Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass Filter</li><li>High Pass Filter</li><li>Band Pass Filter</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passive LC filter market comprises various types of filters, each serving distinct purposes. Low pass filters allow signals below a specific frequency to pass while attenuating higher frequencies. High pass filters do the opposite, enabling signals above a threshold frequency while blocking lower frequencies. Band pass filters combine both functionalities, permitting a defined frequency range to pass and rejecting others. Additional markets include notch filters, which eliminate specific frequencies, and all-pass filters, which adjust phase without affecting amplitude.</p></p>
