<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UVFS Right Angle Prism Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Coated"</li><li>"Uncoated"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UVFS Right Angle Prism market is categorized into two primary types: coated and uncoated. Coated prisms have a specialized thin film applied to their surfaces, enhancing light transmission and reducing reflections, making them ideal for high-performance optical applications. In contrast, uncoated prisms have no additional treatments, which may lead to more light loss but can be more cost-effective for applications where precision is less critical. Each type serves different needs based on performance, cost, and specific application requirements.</p></p>
